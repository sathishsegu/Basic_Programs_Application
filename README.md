## About the Project

This project is a collection of basic Java programs that perform various tasks such as generating Fibonacci sequences, checking for prime numbers, finding factorials, and more. It provides a command-line interface to select and execute these programs.



## Features

1. Generate Fibonacci sequence up to a limit.
2. Check if a number is a palindrome.
3. Display prime numbers within a range.
4. Check if a number is prime.
5. Find the factorial of a number.
6. Generate random numbers within a range.
7. Print ASCII value of a character.
8. Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
9. Count the digits of a number.
10. Display even numbers within a range.
11. Find the largest of three numbers.
12. Display odd numbers within a range.
13. Calculate the power of a number.
14. Calculate the sum of numbers within a range.
15. Swap two numbers.
16. Print all alphabets.
17. Find the nth prime number.
18. Display alternate prime numbers within a range.
